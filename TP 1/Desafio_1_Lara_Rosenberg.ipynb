Was\\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front\\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\\n\\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\\n                             this diagram\\n\\n\\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\\nname.\\n\\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line.

I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since \\nthe initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a \\nservice bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you \\nmay be able to get your dealer to fix it.\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the\\nmailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.\\n\\n\\nDefinitely!\\n\\n\\nNo problems like these either.  I haven\\'t been able to find any obvious \\nplaces where they screwed up.\\n\\n\\nHmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by\\nyour dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \"credit card\" key that \\ncame in the owner\\'s binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key\\ndoesn\\'t have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won\\'t count it. :-))\\n\\n\\nThe latter is probably because of the air bag.  It\\'s pretty much takes up\\nall the space where you\\'d expect to find the horn.\\n\\nSpeaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one\\nof those nice \\'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.\\nThe previous Probes had Japanese horns.\\n\\n\\nYeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.\\n\\n\\nI agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The\\ninterior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically\\nsound.\\n\\n...\\n\\nYes, this car\\'s stiff suspension isn\\'t for everyone.  I personally like it,\\nbut if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I\\'d strongly\\nsuggest looking into the MX-6.\\n\\n\\nThe problem with the back seat is that there\\'s no leg room.  Plenty of \\nhead room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,\\nso long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to \\ngive them a place to put their feet.\\n\\n\\nThe power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)\\nI really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I\\'ve always been a sucker\\nfor open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!\\n\\n\\nI haven\\'t heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes\\n(\\'89 and maybe \\'90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which\\nFord will replace at no charge), but I haven\\'t heard about anything like\\nthis concerning the \\'93 Probes.\\n\\nI haven\\'t had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot\\nthat was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even\\ngave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my\\ncar.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering\\nthat I was expecting the worst from them!\\n\\nFrom what I\\'ve heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with \\nthe Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but \\nI think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That\\'s\\nalmost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\n-chuck-'"

       "\"Here is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President \\nClinton in a question and answer session with the press:\\n\\n1:36 P.M. EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\\ncountry.\""

       "\"THE WHITE HOUSE\\n\\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\\n                  (Vancouver, British Columbia)\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nFor Immediate Release                               April 4, 1993\\n\\n\\t     \\n                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT\\n                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS\\n\\t     \\n                           Canada Place\\n                   Vancouver, British Columbia\\n\\n\\n\\n2:46 P.M. PDT\\n\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you \\ncould probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \\ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \\nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \\nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \\ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \\nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \\nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \\nare the priorities, because there are several association of \\nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \\nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \\nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \\nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \\nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \\npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \\n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \\nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \\nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \\nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \\nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \\nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \\nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \\nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \\nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \\ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \\nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \\nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \\nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \\nsome influence over the distribution of.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \\nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \\nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \\ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \\nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \\nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \\nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \\nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \\nunpopular.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \\nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \\nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \\nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \\nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \\nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \\ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \\npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \\neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \\ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \\nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \\nour side and on the Russian side.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \\ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \\ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \\nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \\nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \\nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \\npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \\nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \\nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \\nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \\ninvestment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \\nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \\nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \\nof the Cold War.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \\nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \\nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \\nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \\nof a very measured breakthrough.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \\nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \\nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \\ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \\nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \\nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \\nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \\nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \\ninherited from the Cold War?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \\nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \\nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \\nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \\ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \\nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \\nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \\nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \\nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \\nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \\non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \\noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \\nwe agreed to continue to press that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \\nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \\nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \\nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \\nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \\nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \\nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \\nthe NPT regime is critical.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     What was the second question?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \\nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \\nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \\nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \\nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \\nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \\nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \\nleadership of the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \\nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \\nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \\nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \\nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \\nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \\nmuch less.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \\nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \\nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \\nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \\nbegin it in the fairly near future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \\nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \\ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \\npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \\nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \\ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \\ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \\nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \\nlast part of your speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \\ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \\nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \\nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \\nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \\nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \\nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \\nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \\nas much as I could about your history.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \\nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \\npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \\nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \\nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \\nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \\nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \\npersonal feeling about Russia.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \\nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \\nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \\nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \\nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \\nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \\nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \\noccurred.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \\non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \\nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \\ncountries become closer partners.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\""

       "'\\nTrue.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\\nseemed to me that they didn\\'t have the stomach for the reality of war,\\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It\\'s like\\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart\\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!\\n\\n\\n[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]\\n                            ^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nI should have said here \"militarily justified\".  It seems from your\\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\\nI apologize.\\n\\n\\nI have often wondered about this.  I\\'ve always thought that the first bomb\\nshould have been dropped on Japan\\'s island fortress of Truk.  A good,\\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\\'ve been held back\\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\\n\\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\\'s\\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \\ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\\'t intervene.  Not that we don\\'t\\ncare, but we can\\'t be the world\\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured\\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\\'t have acted\\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\\'s oil \\ninterests, caused us to take action.\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI\\'m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\\n\\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\\nwould lead their nation to.\\n\\n\\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\\nbut that\\'s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nProbably because we\\'re not the saviors of the world.  We can\\'t police each\\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\\nsome other places.\\n\\nTell me how we could stop them and I\\'ll support it.  I, for one, do not\\nagree with the present US policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it.\\nI agree that it is deplorable.\\n\\n\\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\\nis in order.)  I\\'m not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\\nthe system, but let\\'s not have unfounded allegations of racial \\nprejudice thrown around.\\n\\n\\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn\\'t mean \"those who do the same thing\",\\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\\nposition to understand the defendent\\'s motivation(s).\\n\\n\\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\\n\\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\\n\\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don\\'t accept (without *far*\\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\\n\\n\\nHardly.  I didn\\'t say that it\\'s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don\\'t live in a perfect world and\\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\\'t say\\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\\n\\n\\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\\nand suffering.  I\\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\\'t\\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\\'t see it as\\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\\n\\nBut don\\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\\ndon\\'t!  I just don\\'t condemn those who had to make a difficult\\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\\n\\n\\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\\n\\n\\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\\n\\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don\\'t believe that you can make the\\nsame claim.\\n\\n\\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \\n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\\nwasn\\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \\nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \\n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \\nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \\nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \\nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \\nthe Allied bombing.\\n\\nRegards,'"

       "'GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\\n\\n\\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I\\'ve set all followups to sci.med\\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I\\'m sure most of the\\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\\n\\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\\njust e-mail me and I\\'ll send a summary file to you).  In the general\\npopulation, NT\\'s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don\\'t know the exact percentage -\\nany help here a.p.p.er\\'s?)\\n\\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\\n\\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I\\'ve\\nknown many M.D.\\'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don\\'t oblige them\\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\\n\\nMaybe we need more NF doctor\\'s.  :^)\\n\\nEnough on this subject - let\\'s move on to candida bloom.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \\'anal retentivitis\\', but being\\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\\nmyself in past posts.  Let\\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\\nabove the level of anal effluent.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one\\ndevelops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have\\nbacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune\\nsystem, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual\\ndesensitization.  I now kind of like being called \"anal retentive\" - it has\\na nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the\\npost - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might\\neven cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks again for a great and informative post.  I hope others who have\\nresearched this area and are lurking in the background will post their\\nthoughts as well, no matter their views on this subject.\\n\\nJon Noring\\n\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.'"

       "'\\n       Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the\\nquestion of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal\\nto the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written\\nwith something else in mind and \"propoganda\" put out by its supporters.\\n\\n       But let\\'s be honest about something, here.  When was the last time\\nyou brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?\\n\\n       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can\\'t know what Phill *really*\\nmeans because he\\'s obviously using arguments designed to convince.\\n\\n\\n       If they\\'re true or false, regardles of why they were said, why\\non earth did you make a point of calling them \"propogranda?\"  That\\nwould seem to be irrelevent.\\n\\n\\n       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don\\'t believe\\nthey no longer apply, but that\\'s because I think most of them were\\ngood arguments.  I\\'m not entirely happy about the situation, because\\nthey were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don\\'t\\nthink that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.\\n\\n\\n       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political\\nsystem, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this\\nparticular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure\\nand tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)\\n\\n\\n        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have\\nhad less power?\\n\\n\\n        Phill, we\\'re discusing the power of legislative houses.  While\\nthe Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although\\nbadly) to the U.S. President.\\n\\n        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives\\nis \"in principle\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)\\nbut in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the\\nConstitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh\\ndarn the thing was ratified before they realized they\\'d forgotten to put\\nthose extra restrictions on the Senate in?\\n\\n\\n      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell\\nyou, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of\\ngovernment to \"attack\" which presents them with the best chance of\\ngetting what they want.  With national \"interest groups\" it is simply\\na very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a\\nlaw rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less \\n\"contributions\" to make.  \\n\\n      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at\\nthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little\\nstate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,\\nmedicine, and most other questions.\\n\\n      Local government has not \"failed\" in that it hasn\\'t done what it\\nshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local\\ninterests who want localities to abide by their rules can\\'t get their\\nrules past the local government.  Thus, since they\\'ve got more clout,\\nonly in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because\\nit can impose its will on the lower.\\n\\n      I mean, let\\'s get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres\\nof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-\\nand such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed\\nto a local crime?\\n\\n      The more people want the more Congress will take power to \"sell\"\\nit to them for their votes.  I don\\'t think the rise of \"special interests\"\\nis coincidence with the increased power of Congress.\\n\\n\\n       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual\\nneed matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher\\nlevels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to\\nin effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n       Then why not simply leave New York\\'s education to New York?  I\\nremain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable\\nof educating its own children if that\\'s what they want to do.  And if\\nyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \"pork\" in that\\nstate.  And since industries can\\'t concentrate their political power\\nand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get\\nwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.\\n\\n       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \"buy off\"\\nstates, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.\\n\\n\\n       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself \\nthat you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres\\nhas less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact\\nnational legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem\\nis significantly reduced.\\n\\n\\n       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable\\nto action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering\\nthe government the usually the institution with the sole power to\\nenforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those\\ndecisions a good thing.\\n\\n\\n       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have\\nmore legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution\\nthan the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is\\nharder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing\\nnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out\\nwithout a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the\\nentire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different\\nareas, different solutions may be called for.\\n\\n       And while I often don\\'t agree with the decisions my local\\nand state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to\\nthe city council and shooting my mouth off.  I\\'d much rather the\\nmajority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end\\nup having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in\\nWashington with half a million or more constituents.\\n\\n       I\\'m curious what you base your assumption that lower levels\\nare more corrupt.  \\n\\n\\n       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were\\narguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators\\nshould be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was\\nsuppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was\\nnothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.\\nWhich was when you brought up that we can\\'t decide what the founders\\nwanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,\\nI never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,\\nwhich places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for\\nthe House.\\n\\n\\n       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration\\nof Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other\\nexamples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the\\nreasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)\\n\\n\\n       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something\\nit wasn\\'t intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering\\nthe Congress\\' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they\\nwant them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn\\'t be worrying\\nabout the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which\\nalmost necessitates its abuse.\\n\\n\\n       *BUSH?*  Phill, that\\'s absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of\\nwhich was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that\\'s\\nanything resembling a record.\\n\\n\\n       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system\\nagainst action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when\\ndealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have\\nnot been successful.  When you\\'re in a position of imposing federal\\npower on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to\\ngot through something more than a bare majority\\n\\n\\n       Now we\\'re switching from a general question of a fillibuster\\nto a specific bill.  I don\\'t see how it make a difference.\\n\\n\\n       Sure it\\'s arguable.  Theyr\\'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring\\n60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they\\'ll have to have a *good*\\nargument.  Something that isn\\'t based solely on party lines.\\n\\n\\n       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority\\nfor *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population\\ngroups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities\\nshould have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough\\nabout.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don\\'t advocate the minority\\nbeing capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing\\nthe *federal* system against action.\\n'"

And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that\\'s easy\\nto say from our \"enlightened\" viewpoint here in the 90\\'s, right?  Back\\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \\nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \\nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \\nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All \\nthings considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were\\nessential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick\\nend to avoid even greater allied losses.\\n\\nI, for one, don\\'t regret it.\\n\\n\\nSure.  And it\\'s the people who suffer because of them.  All the more\\nreason to depose these \"entrenched political rulers operating in their\\nown selfish interests\"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies\\nas well??\\n\\n\\nI make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the\\nWest before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\\nstrong response from the West was required.\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s not very \"loving\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\\'d have to\\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\\n\\nI mentioned it.\\n\\nIf we hadn\\'t intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\nSure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in\\nhis grandiose quest for a \"Thousand Year Reich\".  The consequences\\nstemmed from that.\\n\\nWhat should I say about them?  Anything in particular?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American\\nlaw they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black\\nofficers involved, I\\'m sure their would have been black jurors too.\\nThis point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.\\n\\n\\nSo?  It\\'s \"hard to imagine\"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity\\ngained acceptance from the revered author of \"Constructing a Logical\\nArgument\"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)\\n\\n\\nI have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution\\nnor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to\\nthe silence of the principals.  \\n\\n\\nOK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.\\nAnd frankly, the original \"not guilty\" verdict baffled me too.  But then\\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\\'s evident that \\nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \\nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \\nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \\nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \\nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\\n\\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\\n\\n\\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.

       "'\\nTrue.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\\nseemed to me that they didn\\'t have the stomach for the reality of war,\\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It\\'s like\\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart\\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!\\n\\n\\n[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]\\n                            ^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nI should have said here \"militarily justified\".  It seems from your\\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\\nI apologize.\\n\\n\\nI have often wondered about this.  I\\'ve always thought that the first bomb\\nshould have been dropped on Japan\\'s island fortress of Truk.  A good,\\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\\'ve been held back\\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\\n\\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\\'s\\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \\ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\\'t intervene.  Not that we don\\'t\\ncare, but we can\\'t be the world\\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured\\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\\'t have acted\\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\\'s oil \\ninterests, caused us to take action.\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI\\'m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\\n\\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\\nwould lead their nation to.\\n\\n\\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\\nbut that\\'s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nProbably because we\\'re not the saviors of the world.  We can\\'t police each\\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\\nsome other places.\\n\\nTell me how we could stop them and I\\'ll support it.  I, for one, do not\\nagree with the present US policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it.\\nI agree that it is deplorable.\\n\\n\\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\\nis in order.)  I\\'m not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\\nthe system, but let\\'s not have unfounded allegations of racial \\nprejudice thrown around.\\n\\n\\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn\\'t mean \"those who do the same thing\",\\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\\nposition to understand the defendent\\'s motivation(s).\\n\\n\\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\\n\\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\\n\\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don\\'t accept (without *far*\\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\\n\\n\\nHardly.  I didn\\'t say that it\\'s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don\\'t live in a perfect world and\\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\\'t say\\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\\n\\n\\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\\nand suffering.  I\\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\\'t\\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\\'t see it as\\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\\n\\nBut don\\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\\ndon\\'t!  I just don\\'t condemn those who had to make a difficult\\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\\n\\n\\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\\n\\n\\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\\n\\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don\\'t believe that you can make the\\nsame claim.\\n\\n\\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \\n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\\nwasn\\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \\nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \\n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \\nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \\nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \\nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \\nthe Allied bombing.\\n\\nRegards,'"

       "\"Here is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President \\nClinton in a question and answer session with the press:\\n\\n1:36 P.M. EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\\ncountry.\""

       "'Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\\n\\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that\\'s really beside\\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.'"

Today is April 30,\\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\\n\\n  It\\'s now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it\\'s only a dispute\\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it\\'s far\\nmore than that.\\n\\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\\n\\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\\n\\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\\'s navy cannot\\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\\nmatter how risky they may be.\\n\\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\\nmy friends, Her Majesty\\'s navy has sailed into a trap.\\n\\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\\'ve been hearing\\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\\n\\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\\nreign of England\\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \\nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\\'s\\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\\n\\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\\n\\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\\'s\\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\\nNavy.\\n\\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\\n\\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\\n\\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\\nthem.\\n\\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \\nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\\n\\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\\'s\\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\\'s\\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \\nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\\n\\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\\'s this\\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\\n\\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \\nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\\n\\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\\nnot Britain.\\n\\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\\'s\\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\\'s\\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\\nIsland at all?\\n\\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\\nenormous military secret.  It\\'s a giant underground installation\\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \\nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\\nI will describe shortly.\\n\\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\\nWashington.  For the past two months I\\'ve been reporting the\\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\\nand verify them.\\n\\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\\n\\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia\\'s new rulers in the Kremlin are\\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\\nthe world.\\n\\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\\nand Russia\\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\\n\\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \\nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\\nBrothers.\\n\\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \\nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \\nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\\n\\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\\nHemisphere war.\\n\\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\\nbut very little of the air changes places.\\n\\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \\nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \\nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\\nnatural resources.\\n\\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\\nNo. 36.\\n\\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\\nRockefellers.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\\ninherit the Earth.\\n\\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \\nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\\n\\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \\nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\\n\\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\\'s extreme\\nimportance in the coming war.\\n\\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\\ndown virtually to the water\\'s edge.  The other part of the\\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\\n\\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\\nPacific.\\n\\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \\nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \\nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \\nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\\n\\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\\'s. \\nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \\nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\\nappearance both during and after construction.\\n\\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\\n\\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\\'s McNamara\\npresided over the public paring back of America\\'s visible\\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\\n\\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\\ntechniques.\\n\\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\\n\\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\\n\\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\\n\\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\\ngenerates the field.\\n\\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\\nStates Military.  Now it\\'s the American Bolsheviks who are in\\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\\n\\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\\n\\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\\nWAR ONE.\\n\\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\\nWashington.  It\\'s a plan by which the United States will strike\\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\\nwith Russia.\\n\\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\\n\\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\\nfast running out.\\n\\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\\ncertain ways.\\n\\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\\n\\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \\nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\\n\\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\\n\\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\\nare known to be as I described last month.\\n\\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \\nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\\n\\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\\n\\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\\n\\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\\nalso its Achilles\\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\\n\\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\\ndo.\\n\\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\\n\\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\\nthe Argentine flag.\\n\\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\\n\\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\\'s point of\\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\\n\\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \\nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\\nwould be a nerve gas.\\n\\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\\ncontrolled.  That\\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\\n\\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\\ndoors would be suicide.\\n\\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \\nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\\npreparations.\\n\\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \\nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\\'s Foreign Minister,\\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \\nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\\ncertain officials.  He got them!\\n\\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \\nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\\n\\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\\nshambles of the plan.\\n\\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\\nknown, there were no survivors.\\n\\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\\nresults, both important:\\n\\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\\n\\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\\nNew Zealand!\\n\\n   The British ship\\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed by\\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \\nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\\n\\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\\nstill out of range.\\n\\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\\ntactics which the Russians employed.\\n\\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \\nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \\nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\\naround the world.\\n\\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \\nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\\n\\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\\n\\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\\nthere were a nuclear war.\\n\\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\\nmoney--and plenty of it.\\n\\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\\nmachine at work.  As I\\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefeller\\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\\n\\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\\nand Russia; but as Russia\\'s new rulers know very well, this does\\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\\nRockefeller group.  It\\'s purely a matter of practical necessity\\nright now for the Rockefellers.\\n\\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it\\'s scaring people. \\nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\\n\\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\\n\\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\\n\\n   Now it\\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\\'s Waterloo at sea\\nmay well be at hand.\\n\\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"'"

       "'From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\\n\\n\\nZionism and the Holocaust\\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\\n\\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\\nanti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\\n\\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\\n\\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\\nEurope\\'s workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\\nJewish state.\\n\\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the \\'Jewish\\nproblem\\'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\\nbe considered by German Jews.\\n\\nThe best example of this was the \\'Transfer Agreement\\' of 1934.\\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\\nout, the campaign would collapse.\\n\\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\\nrace, nation, and the nature of the \\'Jewish problem\\', and it\\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\\n\\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\\n\\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany\\'s Jews out of\\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\\n\\'helping\\' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\\nJews come and agree with them.\\n\\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the \\'new\\nJew\\' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\\n\\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\\n\\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen\\'s play\\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\\n\\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner\\'s\\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary\\'s Jews to\\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\\nconditions were met.\\n\\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\\nwork camps.\\n\\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\\ndestruction: the trains of \\'prominents\\' which Eichmann promised to\\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\\nJews.\\n\\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\\n\\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\\nJews.'"

       "'\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\\n\\nMAGI: \\n\\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.'"

But, it has never been the possession\\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\\nin the history of the world.

Greek\\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\\n\\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more.

Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.\\n \\n  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk\\n  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):\\n  pub/cypherpunks/hal\\'s.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX\\n  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to\\n  aid remailer use).\\n\\n  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\\n  -----------------------------\\n    Anonymized mail.

Request information from above address.\\n\\n  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu \\n  -----------------------------\\n    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger\\' site\\n    address for information.\\n\\n  Notes\\n  =====\\n  \\n  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often\\n    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues\\n    are wholly unresolved.\\n  \\n  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\\n    software (see the question on cryptography). \\n\\n  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\\n    vary between sites.\\n\\n  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\\n    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\\n\\n_____\\n<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\\n\\n  \\n  Users\\n  -----\\n\\n  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\\n    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\\n  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\\n  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\\n    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\\n  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\\n    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\\n    network traffic.\\n  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\\n    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt\\'\\n    hierarchy is preferred.\\n  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\\n    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\\n    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\\n    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\\n    future ones under the same handle.\\n  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\\n    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\\n    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\\n  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \\n    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\\n  - Be considerate and respectful of other\\'s objections to anonymity.\\n  - ``Hit-and-run\\'\\' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\\n    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\\n  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\\n    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\\n    his hardware, all for your convenience.\\n\\n  Operators\\n  ---------\\n\\n  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\\n    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\\n    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\\n    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\\n    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\\n    lassaiz-faire?\\n  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\\n    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\\n    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\\n    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\\n    users trust you to protect them.\\n  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\\n    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\\n    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\\n    the account, \\'out\\' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\\n  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\\n    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\\n    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\\n    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\\n    ``(in)stability of anonymity\\'\\'.\\n  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\\n    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\\n    your commitment to it?\\n  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\\n    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \\n    Consult a lawyer about your liability.\\n  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\\n    to deal with complaints and `hate mail\\' addressed to you.  If you\\n    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\\n    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\\n  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\\n    possible, query group readers.\\n  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\\n    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\\n    the key text `Anon\\' is  somewhere in every header.\\n  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\\n    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\\n\\n  Readers\\n  -------\\n  \\n  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\\n    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\\n    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\\n    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\\n    volume is heavy or increasing).\\n  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters\\n    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate\\n    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.\\n  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,\\n    harassment, extortion, etc.\\n  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they\\n    offend you personally.\\n  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the\\n    idea of anonymity itself.\\n  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings\\n    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible\\' or\\n    `conceivable\\' need exists.\\n\\n  References\\n  ----------\\n  \\n  See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:\\n\\n  > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual\\n  > privacy and the use of handles.

Not perfect and won\\'t\\n  > kill followups. \\n  \\n  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask\\n  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so\\n  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common\\n  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.\\n  \\n_____\\n<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?\\n\\n  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for\\n  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is\\n  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\\n  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\\n  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\\n  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\\n  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\\n  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\\n  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\\n  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\\n  servers like there\\'s no tomorrow.\\'\\'\\n  \\n  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax\\' and interested in\\n  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\\n  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\\n  server to new, more `mainstream\\'  groups was starting to emerge,\\n  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\\n  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\\n  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\\n  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\\n  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.\\'\\' \\n  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\\n  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\\n  against it. \\n\\n  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher\\'\\' to\\n  `squelch\\' or `plonk\\' abusive users in response to complaints, and\\n  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\\n  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\\n  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\\n  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\\n  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\\n  created.\\'\\'\\n\\n  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\\n  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\\n  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\\n  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\\n  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\\n  accessability in response to \\'lots\\' of international requests.\\n  \\n  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\\n  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\\n  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\\n  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\\n  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\\n  ``routine\\'\\' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\\n  anonymity is also controversial.\\n\\n  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\\n  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\\n  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\\n  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\\n  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\\n  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\\n  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\\n  vociferous outrage at the poster\\'s use of anonymity, reverberating\\n  through many newsgroups. \\n  \\n  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\\n  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,\\'\\'\\n  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\\n  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\\n  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\\n  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\\n  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\\n  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\\n  detractors.\\n\\n  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\\n  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\\n  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\\n  extingisher\\'\\' and the ``group bouncer\\'\\' mechanisms that limit the\\n  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\\n  best described as `inundated\\': it has registered over 13,000 users\\n  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\\n  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\\n  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\\n  to the capability for `global\\' anonymity which has allowed users to\\n  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\\n\\n  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\\n  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\\n  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\\n  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\\n  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\\n  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\\n  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing\\' through it\\n  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\\n  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\\n  service\\'s administration. In response to the serious threats he\\n  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\\n  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\\n  \\n  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\\n  ``cypherpunks,\\'\\' J. Helsingius has identified many security\\n  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\\n  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\\n  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\\n  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\\n  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\\n  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\\n  etc.\\n\\n  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\\n  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\\n  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\\n  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\\n  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\\n  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\\n  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\\n  software to the public domain.\\n\\n  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing\\' on\\n  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\\n  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\\n  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\\n  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\\n  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\\n  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\\n  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\\n  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\\n  encryption.\\n\\n  See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting\\'\\' below and ``what\\n  is going on with anon.penet.fi?\\'\\' in this document.\\n  \\n  (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\\n  <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\\n  contributions here.)\\n\\n\\n_____\\n<8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\\n\\n  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\\n    \\n  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\\n  > content of one\\'s message.

       "\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\\nSubject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis\\n\\n\\nDear Josh\\n\\nI appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.\\n\\nHaving said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.\\n\\n1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are\\njust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic\\ncountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or\\nreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?\\n\\n2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all\\nkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.\\nYou did not respond to my question.\\n\\n3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is\\ninteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear\\nweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?\\n\\n4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a\\nMa'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases\\nlike Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about\\nthose about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and\\nimprisoned.\\n\\n5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status\\nof the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I\\nunderstand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for\\nthe occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).\\nThe law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,\\nwhy doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?\\n\\n6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return\\nconflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands\\nof non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under\\nIsrael control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from\\nreturning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also\\nleft, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to\\nreturn. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?\\nIs the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge\\nsomewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in\\nhis homeland ?\\n\\n7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an\\norder for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that\\ninformation, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all\\ninhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These\\nexpulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other\\natrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by\\nIsraeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the\\nPalestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University\\nPress. Is this book available in your library ?\\n\\n8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in\\nIsraeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very\\nlittle evidence available about that. As much as I know, many\\nArabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are\\nnot accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want\\nArabs ?\\n\\n9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was\\nwhether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to\\ndiscourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but\\nevaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants\\nto keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious\\ncommunities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish\\ncivil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests\\nto officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a\\nsecular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.\\n\\n\\nI would be glad to have some more input from you after these\\ncomments.\""

       "'GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\\n\\n\\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I\\'ve set all followups to sci.med\\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I\\'m sure most of the\\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\\n\\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\\njust e-mail me and I\\'ll send a summary file to you).  In the general\\npopulation, NT\\'s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don\\'t know the exact percentage -\\nany help here a.p.p.er\\'s?)\\n\\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\\n\\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I\\'ve\\nknown many M.D.\\'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don\\'t oblige them\\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\\n\\nMaybe we need more NF doctor\\'s.  :^)\\n\\nEnough on this subject - let\\'s move on to candida bloom.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \\'anal retentivitis\\', but being\\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\\nmyself in past posts.  Let\\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\\nabove the level of anal effluent.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one\\ndevelops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have\\nbacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune\\nsystem, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual\\ndesensitization.  I now kind of like being called \"anal retentive\" - it has\\na nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the\\npost - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might\\neven cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks again for a great and informative post.  I hope others who have\\nresearched this area and are lurking in the background will post their\\nthoughts as well, no matter their views on this subject.\\n\\nJon Noring\\n\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.'"

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \\ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \\nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \\npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \\nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \\nand opportunity in the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \\nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \\nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \\ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \\nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \\ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \\nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \\nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \\nreach some accord.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \\nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \\nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \\nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \\nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \\nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \\nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \\nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \\nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \\nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \\nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \\nconsistent with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\""

       "'\\nI hope I didn\\'t award custody, Rich.  I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \\navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \\nthink the masses can\\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuch obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn\\'t it?  Well, I am\\nsure there are plenty of \"scientific\" creationist \"rebuttals\" out there \\nsomewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.\\n\\n[just for the record, again, AMH = anatomically modern humans] \\n\\nBest regards :-),'"
